# basic-python-blockchain
This project is a basic blockchain project inspired by bitcoin. 
The project is mainly to understand the concept and system of blockchain, transaction and cryptography.

### review/regret
- I should've worked on this project in test driven. 
- I should've been used to git and github before the project.
- I should've established the development environment with docker.
